# WCF Relay vs Hybrid Connection Comparison

This document provides a detailed technical comparison between the two implementations of the Azure Relay Tunneling Utility.

## Quick Decision Guide

**Use Hybrid Connection if:**
- ✅ Starting a new project
- ✅ Deploying to production
- ✅ Security is a priority
- ✅ Need modern authentication (Azure AD, Managed Identity)
- ✅ Want cross-platform support (Linux, macOS)

**Use WCF Relay only if:**
- ⚠️ Maintaining existing WCF infrastructure
- ⚠️ Development/testing only (NOT production)
- ⚠️ Have .NET Framework dependency that can't be migrated

**Bottom Line:** Use **RelayTunnelUsingHybridConnection** for all new projects and production deployments.

## Comparative Summary

| Aspect | Hybrid Connection | WCF Relay |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Recommendation** | ✅ Use for all new projects | ⚠️ Legacy support only |
| **Production Ready** | ✅ Yes | ❌ Security concerns |
| **.NET Version** | .NET 8 (cross-platform) | .NET Framework 4.8 (Windows only) |
| **Security** | ✅ Active support | ❌ Deprecated libraries |
| **Authentication** | Azure CLI, Service Principal, Managed Identity, SAS | SAS key only |
| **Dynamic Resources** | ✅ ARM template automation | ✅ Runtime registration only |

## Technology Foundation

| Aspect | Hybrid Connection | WCF Relay |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Protocol** | WebSocket-based | WCF SOAP/HTTP |
| **Library** | Microsoft.Azure.Relay 2.0.0+ | Legacy WCF libraries |
| **Azure Service** | Azure Relay - Hybrid Connections | Azure Relay - WCF Relay |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Actively maintained | ❌ Deprecated |
| **Framework** | .NET 8 | .NET Framework 4.8 |
| **Platform** | Windows, Linux, macOS | Windows only |

## Security Analysis

### Hybrid Connection ✅ RECOMMENDED
- ✅ Actively maintained libraries with security updates
- ✅ Modern authentication (Azure AD, Managed Identity, Service Principal)
- ✅ TLS 1.2+ enforced
- ✅ Regular security patches from Microsoft
- ✅ **Safe for production use**

### WCF Relay ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING
- ❌ **Uses deprecated libraries with no security updates**
- ❌ Potential unpatched vulnerabilities
- ❌ Only SAS key authentication (no Azure AD integration)
- ❌ **Not recommended for production use**
- ✅ Acceptable for development/testing environments only

**Security is the #1 reason to choose Hybrid Connection over WCF.**

## Resource Management

### Dynamic Resources

**Hybrid Connection:**
- Creates/deletes hybrid connection via ARM API
- Resources appear/disappear in Azure Portal automatically
- Requires Azure authentication
- Perfect for dev/test environments

**WCF Relay:**
- Relay endpoint appears when app runs
- Disappears when app stops
- No pre-creation needed
- No persistent Azure resources

### Static Resources

**Hybrid Connection:**
- Connect to pre-created hybrid connections
- Resources persist after app stops
- No Azure management permissions needed
- Better for production

**WCF Relay:**
- N/A - WCF relays don't support static pre-created resources

## Summary

### Hybrid Connection (RelayTunnelUsingHybridConnection)
**Use for:** New projects, production, modern .NET applications

**Strengths:**
- Modern, actively maintained
- Secure with ongoing updates
- Cross-platform support
- Advanced Azure integration

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more complex setup (if using dynamic resources)
- Requires .NET 8

### WCF Relay (RelayTunnelUsingWCF)
**Use for:** Legacy support, development/testing only

**Strengths:**
- Simple configuration
- Works with existing .NET Framework apps

**Trade-offs:**
- ⚠️ **Deprecated libraries - security risk**
- No ongoing support
- Windows-only
- Limited authentication options
