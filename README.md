# Azure Relay Tunneling Utility

**Version: 1.5.1**

An HTTP tunneling utility based on Azure Relay. Forward HTTP traffic from Azure to your local machine for debugging and development.

## üéØ What Does This Do?

This utility creates a secure tunnel between Azure and your local machine, allowing you to:
- Expose local web servers, APIs, or HTTP services through Azure endpoints
- Debug bots and agents locally while receiving real traffic from Azure-hosted channels
- Test with real ChannelData from channels like WebChat, Teams, Skype
- Develop and test without deploying to Azure
- Access localhost services from anywhere via Azure Relay

## üì¶ Choose Your Project

This repository contains two implementations using different Azure Relay technologies:

### [RelayTunnelUsingHybridConnection](Src/RelayTunnelUsingHybridConnection/README.md) ‚úÖ **Recommended**
**Technology:** Azure Relay Hybrid Connections (.NET 8)  
**Best For:** Modern development, production use, dynamic resource management

**Protocol Support:**
- ‚úÖ HTTP/REST (request/response patterns)
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connections

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Modern .NET 8 implementation
- ‚úÖ Dynamic resource creation - hybrid connections appear/disappear automatically
- ‚úÖ Multiple authentication options (Azure CLI, Service Principal, Managed Identity)
- ‚úÖ Multi-relay support in single application
- ‚úÖ Actively maintained

**[üìñ Full Documentation ‚Üí](Src/RelayTunnelUsingHybridConnection/README.md)**

### [RelayTunnelUsingWCF](Src/RelayTunnelUsingWCF/README.md)
**Technology:** WCF Relay (.NET Framework 4.8)  
**Best For:** Legacy systems, existing WCF infrastructure

**Protocol Support:**
- ‚úÖ HTTP/REST (request/response patterns)
- ‚ùå WebSocket connections **NOT supported**

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ WCF Relay endpoints
- ‚úÖ Dynamic relay registration (appears when running)
- ‚úÖ .NET Framework 4.8
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning:** Uses deprecated Azure libraries with no ongoing security updates

**‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended for production use due to deprecated dependencies**

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose your project** (Hybrid Connection recommended for new projects)
2. **Follow the project-specific README** for detailed setup instructions
3. **Configure your bot's messaging endpoint** in Azure to point to your relay
4. **Run the utility** and test your bot locally

## üìä Quick Comparison

| Feature | Hybrid Connection | WCF Relay |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **.NET Version** | .NET 8 | .NET Framework 4.8 |
| **HTTP/REST Support** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **WebSocket Support** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Production Ready** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è **No - Security Risk** |
| **Security Updates** | ‚úÖ Active support | ‚ùå Deprecated libraries |
| **Authentication** | Azure CLI, Service Principal, Managed Identity | SAS key only |
| **Dynamic Resources** | ‚úÖ ARM template automation | ‚úÖ Runtime registration |

**Recommendation:** Use RelayTunnelUsingHybridConnection for all new projects and production deployments.
